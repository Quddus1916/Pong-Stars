# Pong-Stars
Multiplayer Ping Pong Game For Beginners

Java Project, for the Second Semester. Team: Syntax Sinners.

Our idea is to create an offline multiplayer game, where each player will sit at the opposite ends of the console and control a bar. The bar will bounce a ball and if any player misses to hit the ball with the bar, the ball goes past through the player resulting in the opponent player's win. We tried to implement the program in C#, written in Visual Studio with the Unity Engine.
